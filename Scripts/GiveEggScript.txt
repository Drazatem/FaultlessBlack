/* 
The following contains the basic structure of a GiveEgg script (for SAK) which gives the player an egg with a random species. It follows through the same motions as GameFreak's traditional Egg Gift sequencing. 
When adding this script to a zone, ensure the script number is changed appropriately, the appropriate text bank is edited (with the NPCMessages calling the right text messages) and you've chosen your desired species. Currently they're all set to 0xA5, because Ledyba is a really cool guy. :) 
If you've already set flags in other scripts, make sure you use an unused flag. Unused flags can be found here (bw2) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bDCSu8Th7LeAHu-Z309maTc2fcZ_dIwqUbp0n8PW50M/edit#gid=0
If you'd like the NPC to tell the player what Pokemon will be in the egg you can add a new message and use PKMNSpeciesToStrbuf in conjunction with an additional NPCMessage. 
Finally, if you're unsure on how parts of the script work, there is a version with comments found further below. Best viewed as a C file.
